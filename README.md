# musicat

Musicat requires C# and was developed in Visual Studio 2010.

This repository contains two things:

  1. trunk/ : a very old proto-version of Musicat
  2. RhythmCat/ : the final version of Musicat described in my dissertation (that version was named "RhythmCat" internally). 

It may be necessary to install the "Fughetta" font for proper rendering of some music notation.

Download the musicat.zip file as an alternative to cloning the repo, if desired.
